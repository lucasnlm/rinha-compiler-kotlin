## Docker

You can also use the docker image to run the interpreter.

```bash
docker build -t "rinha:Dockerfile" .
docker run -it rinha:Dockerfile

# rinhak will run the json AST of rinha generated code
# rinha should already be available to use too.
./rinhak files/print.json
```

You can also call `rinha file.rinha` to generate a new Json.
